Style.com Image Crawler
=======
This crawler will browse Style.com collection slideshows and pull the urls of all the images within the slideshow. 

To Use
------
Make sure [Python 3.4+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) (`pip install requests`), and [Beautiful Soup 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) (`pip install beautifulsoup4`) are installed. Then navigate to the folder containing crawler.py via command line / terminal (**NOT python terminal**) and execute `python crawler.py <url>`.

Pull requests
-------
I'm not sure that there's much work to be done on this, but if someone wants to add something I'm happy to incorporate pull requests.
